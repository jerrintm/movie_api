This is the documentation file

--- Who, Your immediate users will be frontend developers who’ll work on the client-side for the
application based on what’s been documented on the server-side (in this case, this developer
is also you!). You should also consider the users of the myFlix application. These will be
movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about different movies.

--- What, The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic,
and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and
architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
(CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
way.
--- When, Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like
to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
list of “Favorite Movies.”
Where, The application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and
can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
--- Why—Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies,
directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access
to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
stored.

The Database is hosted in MongoDB cloud.


Tips
------
Postman API call can be made to code hosted in cloud using the cloud URL for this app OR via localhost where the code is
available on a locally machine.
The local machine is useful for troubleshooting purposes.
The changes can then be pushed to GitHub and Heroku(For Heroku, command to push changes - 'git push heroku main' )
